# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), focusing on building a basic multi-page HTML website. The project showcases a collection of recipes using fundamental HTML elements.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate core HTML skills, including creating multiple pages with headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links. By completing this project, I have improved my understanding of basic HTML structure and page layout.

## What I Learned

- Creating multi-page websites using HTML  
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images  
- Adding links between pages  
- Organizing files and folders for a simple website  

This project provides a foundation for more advanced web development topics.
