        <h2>üçó Description</h2>
        <p>This is a classic Italian-style dish featuring tender, thin-cut chicken breasts pan-fried until lightly golden, then simmered with mushrooms in a rich, slightly sweet Marsala wine sauce. It's elegant enough for dinner guests yet easy enough for a weekday meal.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (pounded thin)</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Dried oregano</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>Marsala wine</li>
            <li>Cooking sherry (optional, per recipe variation)</li>
            <li>Chicken stock or broth</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a shallow dish, whisk together flour, salt, pepper, and dried oregano.</li>
            <li>Dredge the chicken pieces in the seasoned flour mixture, shaking off excess.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken until lightly browned on both sides. Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add mushrooms to the skillet and saut√© until softened.</li>
            <li>Pour in Marsala wine (and sherry if used), scraping the pan to release browned bits.</li>
            <li>Return the chicken to the skillet, cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes, flipping once, until fully cooked through.</li>
            <li>When juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink, serve hot with the sauce spooned over top.</li>
        </ol>
